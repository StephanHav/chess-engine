# Chess Engine

This is a repo containing the code for a challenge among some friends to code a chess engine without the use of any AI/LLM tooling and no copying of code. Therefore, please forgive any poor coding practice applied in this repo, this is python code straight from my brain into a script only using a Python documentation page. 

## Goals

- Implement a fully working Chess Engine that can calculate all legal moves given any possible composition of pieces on the board.

- Calculate 'best' move from set of all possible moves.

- Have it play against the chess engine of my friends and see who wins. 

## Status

Currently the Chess Engine is very much in development, given any possible position, the engine can currently calculate: 

- [ ] Pawn moves
    - [x] Take
    - [x] Move 1 square
    - [x] Move 2 squares at start
    - [ ] En passant
    - [ ] Promotion 

- [x] Knight moves 

- [ ] Bishop moves

- [ ] Rook moves

- [ ] Queen moves

- [ ] King moves
